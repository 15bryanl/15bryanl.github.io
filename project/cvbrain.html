        <p id="AMtext" style="font-weight:bold">Project Definition, Audience and Scope:</p> 
        <p id="AMtext">Currently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become recognized as a 
            new efficient method in classification. CNNs have proven to be more effective at image 
            classification than humans, which has established the use of deep learning in brain imaging. 
            Thus CNN has rapidly become the choice in improving brain diagnosis, treatment and characterization, 
            which benefits from accurate segmentation.</p> 
        <p id="AMtext">For example, the ability to segment and visualize the thalamus 
            would allow us to determine whether trauma or disfigurement of certain areas of 
            the thalamus would indicate the possibility of developing certain disorders or syndromes. 
            One example of spatial specific injury that leads to disorder is trauma to the Anterior 
            thalamic nucleus, which would lead to the development of anterograde amnesia. While 
            current methods require us to segment and analyze by hand, our goal is to optimize this 
            process for faster and more accurate diagnosis.

        <p id="AMtext" style="font-weight:bold">Our Solution:</p>

            <p id="AMtext">Currently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become recognized as a 
                    new efficient method in classification. CNNs have proven to be more effective at image 
                    classification than humans, which has established the use of deep learning in brain imaging. 
                    Thus CNN has rapidly become the choice in improving brain diagnosis, treatment and characterization, 
                    which benefits from accurate segmentation.</p> 
        <p id="AMtext" style="font-weight:bold">Product:</p>
            <p id="AMtext">Our CNN was trained on 10 images and 8 for testing purposes. After training on 10 images, 
                we obtained a very clear and fluid segmentation and used an ADAM optimization of 0.0001 in our CNN 
                for highest accuracy. We utilized 5 epochs because less epochs displayed less feature data from the input image 
                while more epochs had negligible improvement. We were careful not to overfit the data, which 
                results from training on the same data set repeatedly.
            </p>
            <p id="AMtext">Additionally, we varied our CNN by changing the kernel size. Larger kernel size meant 
                more required memory for weights and more computation time for back-propagation. Smaller kernel 
                size meant a drop in accuracy. Thus we chose a 3x3x3 kernel, which straddle the two extremes. 
                Our CNN performed poorly when we experimented with training on all 43 individual structures. Our 
                filter size provided limited feature detection, which can be an area for improvement. We may 
                also improve network performance by increasing the number of convolutional layers to deepen 
                the network, which would boost performance by learning more complex, non-linear behaviors. </p>
        <p id="AMtext" style="font-weight:bold">Evaluation:</p>
            <p id="AMtext">we had decided to experiment with a convolutional neural network to accurately segment
                 subcortical structures in brain MRI image scans. Our tests indicate that our proposed method can 
                 be an effective and efficient approach at brain segmentation for diagnosis, however, we must 
                 understand that there are limitations: currently our model cannot detect more structures as 
                 it had trouble learning more than our seven proposed classes. Also, due to system and memory 
                 limitations, we couldnâ€™t get more accurate results. However, with better infrastructure, and 
                 a deeper neural network, segmentation can become more accurate and better optimized.
